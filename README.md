# Visualizing The Four Fundamental Subspaces

This short write-up was created after discussing various word problems with Justin Curry during office hours while I was enrolled in a firs course in linear programming. I was a little rusty with my linear algebra; this was attempt to lay out a framework for interpreting the four fundamental subspaces in the style of MIT OCW handouts.

From the introduction:

> In particular, I hope this exercise will help tie together the concepts of
solving a system of linear equations with the Four Fundamental Subspaces in the
context of a linear programming problem.
