# Visualizing The Four Fundamental Subspaces

This short write-up was created after discussing various word problems with Justin Curry during office hours while I was enrolled in a firs course in linear programming. I was a little rusty with my linear algebra; this was attempt to lay out a framework for interpreting the four fundamental subspaces in the style of MIT OCW handouts.
